    - ANOVA Testing
    - Model Transformations (Box-Cox)
    - Post Hoc Analysis
    - Normality Techniques utilizing residuals
    - VIFs
- Explores Machine Learning Algorithms and Concepts
    - XGBoost for Regression
    - K-Fold Cross Validation
    - Model Performances
- Implemented an app via streamlit where students can input their academic profiles and see their admission chances
